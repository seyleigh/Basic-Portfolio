               <p>I am another millennial looking to find my path. Growing up I've worked a lot of odd jobs; UPS delivery driver aid, cleaning boats, CNA, Tour guide, Walmart associate, baker, and most recently a RSS at O'reilly Auto Parts. I climbed the ranks at O'reillys quickly and found myself in the position of Acting Manager. I realized even quicker that Management in retail is not what I want to do with the rest of my life. </p>

               <p>I found the UNC Bootcamp through an instagram ad. This will probably be the one instance in my life that I'm thankful for the FBI spying on me (Thanks FBI guy.) I'm hoping to be launched into a new career where I can discover a new passion and excell in creating wonderful and awesome things.</p>
